.. _stacked_seds:

The stacked_seds array
=======================

Once the stacking has been performed, the stacked SEDs are saved in an Xarray object, together with all the metadata regarding binning and units. You can check the :ref:`Getting started <quickstart>` for a guide on how to compute stacked SEDs from a galaxy catalog, but you can also just load and return an already existing stack using a `Stacker` instance::

    st.load_stack('path/to/stack_folder')
    stacked_seds = st.return_stack()


Of course, you can also load an already existing `stacked_seds` array directly with Xarray::

    import xarray as xr
    stacked_seds = xr.open_datarray('path/to/stack_folder/stacked_seds.nc')


Here, we will just show how to access all the relevant information of a `stacked_seds` array, as generated by stonp. For an in-depth description of the xarray objects, please refer to the `Xarray <https://xarray.dev/>`_ documentation.
